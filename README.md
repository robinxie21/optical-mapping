# Rhythm | MATLAB Package for Analyzing Optical Mapping Data
Rhythm is a MATLAB-based graphical user interface to display, condition, and analyze data optical mapping data for cardiac electrophysiology experiments. This program was designed to load and process data from the MiCAM ULTIMA imaging system from SciMedia. This current version is optimized to process voltage data only. Later versions of this software package will include analysis of voltage and calcium data collected from multiple cameras.

# Features
* Easy data display
* Multiple signal conditioning options
* Code for activation maps, conduction velocity maps, apd maps, and phase analysis
* Ability to create movies and export individual signals

# Requirements
We recommend the latest release of 64-bit MATLAB on a 64-bit machine. We have tested this package on both windows and mac platforms. This code was originally created for a mac. While functionality is unchanged on windows machines, GUI display may be a bit irregular on MATLAB for windows.

# Contributions
If you would like to contribute to this project, please contact Dr. Igor Efimov at igor@wustl.edu. If you find this code helpful, please reference our review paper describing proper analysis of optical mapping data found at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22821993

# Nottice!!!
Until we can fully perfect the use of Github distribution, we recommend the URL (Google Drive) below for the most up-to-date release of Rhythm
